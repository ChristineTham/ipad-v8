# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

A native iPad app that runs Research Unix (V8 first, V10 as the end goal) on an emulated
VAX — open-simh `vax780` — displayed through an emulated DMD 5620 terminal (`dmd_core`),
joined by a virtual serial line inside one iOS process. Full-system emulation is the load-
bearing decision: the Research Unix kernel forks processes inside the emulated machine, so
iOS's no-fork/no-JIT restrictions never apply, and both cores are plain AOT-compiled
interpreters (App Store-legal per UTM SE / iAltair precedent).

**Current state: Track A1 complete.** `libsimh/` builds open-simh's `vax780` as
`SimhVAX.xcframework`; `app/` is the Edition iPad app (SwiftTerm console) that boots V8
to `login:` in ~25–30 s and survives background/foreground via SIMH save/restore.
Implementation record: [docs/a1-notes.md](docs/a1-notes.md). Next: A2 (the Blit
experience) and Track B. [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) is the evidence base for every
decision; trust it over memory, and record decision changes in the living docs, not by
rewriting the study.

## Commands

Track A commands (media prerequisites still come from the A0 workbench below —
`work/myv8/rp06v8.golden` + `bootV8` must exist before the app build embeds them):

```bash
# Build SimhVAX.xcframework (clones open-simh into work/ pinned to the verified rev)
libsimh/build-xcframework.sh
```

```bash
# Build the Edition iPad app for the simulator
cd app && xcodebuild -project Edition.xcodeproj -scheme Edition -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro 13-inch (M5)' build
```

```bash
# Desktop round-trip of the full app protocol against the library (boot → suspend/save → restore)
bash work/verify-libcli.sh
```

The **Phase A0 desktop spike** commands are in [docs/spike-a0.md](docs/spike-a0.md)
(build SIMH `vax780`, produce `v8.disk` via timnewsham/myv8, connect a 5620/Blit terminal
emulator, run `mux`), all inside the gitignored `work/` directory.

Proven workbench commands (from the A0 spike; run from repo root):

```bash
# Boot V8 to multiuser and hold (console stays on this terminal)
cd work/myv8 && PATH="$PWD/../simh312/sim/BIN:$PATH" expect ../boot-hold.exp
```

```bash
# Prove a DZ login + exercise the system (separate shell, after boot)
python3 work/dztalk.py
```

Toolchains:
- App shell (real since A1): Swift/SwiftUI, `app/Edition.xcodeproj` — hand-authored,
  synchronized-folder format. **Code signing: always the Hello Tham Pty. Ltd. org team —
  `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = RPL5R637DS` — never the personal team** (set at creation, verified
  2026-08-09). Metal arrives with A2.
- VAX core (real since A1): open-simh as a C static library — `libsimh/` (CMake →
  xcframework; scp's `main` renamed via `-Dmain` only; no async/network/SDL).
- Terminal core (A2, planned): dmd_core as a Rust `aarch64-apple-ios` staticlib via its
  C FFI.

## Architecture (the big picture)

Two interpreters and a wire, mirroring the real 1985 topology (smart terminal ↔ serial line
↔ headless host):

- **SIMH thread** boots the disk image; its DZ11 line 0 is the wire's host end
  (`set noasync` mandatory).
- **dmd thread** runs the WE32100 terminal; its DUART port A is the wire's other end;
  its 800×1024×1 framebuffer is what the user sees.
- **Serial transport** starts as a localhost telnet loopback (zero-patch, proven shape) and
  must evolve into an unthrottled in-process byte queue — realistic serial pacing makes the
  `mux` download take ~17 minutes, the project's #1 UX risk.
- The shell is **edition-agnostic**: machines = SIMH simulator + disk image + wiring. V10
  arrives later as just another image (Track B builds it *inside* the running V8 — V10 has
  never been booted by anyone; that restoration is half the project).

Full spec: [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) · Phases:
[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) · V10 plan: [docs/v10-restoration.md](docs/v10-restoration.md)

## Decisions (settled — don't relitigate without new evidence)

- Full-system emulation, native code. **Not** WASM, **not** iSH-style user-mode.
- End goal is V10, staged through V8. **V9 is skipped** (surviving V9 = Sun-3 port, no VAX
  kernel code).
- Free app, self-contained, no ads/IAP — required by the 2017 non-commercial covenant;
  **"UNIX" must not appear in the app name** (Open Group trademark). Binding rules:
  [docs/licensing.md](docs/licensing.md).

## Gotchas (each cost the community real debugging time)

- Naming trap: in Research tapes, `jerq/` = DMD 5620 (WE32100); `blit/` = original 68000
  Blit. The "current" V8/V10 terminal is the 5620.
- dmd_core must run firmware **8;7;3** for Research Unix `mux` (default 8;7;5 fails).
- SIMH newer than 3.9 needs `set noasync` or V8 corrupts RP06 I/O (simh issue #425).
- V8's getty sends the first `login:` with **mark parity** (bit 7 set) — byte-matchers must
  strip the high bit until after login.
- `mux` is not on root's PATH — invoke `/usr/jerq/bin/mux`.
- SIMH `vax780` burns ~97% of a core while V8 idles (no idle detection) — a design
  constraint for the iPad app, and worth killing the simulator when not in use.
- dmd_core's GitHub HEAD embeds only the **8;7;5** ROM, which V8's `32ld` download crashes
  (unimplemented `MOVTRW` + unaligned access in the WE32100 core, ~30 KB in) — this is the
  mechanism behind the documented "use firmware 8;7;3" requirement. Serial pacing lives in
  dmd_core's DUART (wall-clock per-char at programmed baud; fresh NVRAM = 1200 baud), not
  in SIMH. Details: docs/spike-a0-results.md, Session 2.
- The **canonical** dmd repos are on git.loomcom.com (Gitea; HTML bot-walled, `git clone` +
  API work) — GitHub mirrors are stale. Canonical dmd_core 0.7.1: `reset(1)` = 8;7;3.
  Three emulator gotchas cost this project a day: the 8;7;3 self-test needs BREAK delivered
  as a 0x00 byte (patched); the kb FIFO drops keys typed faster than ~ms (type at 100 ms);
  the DUART needs a ~real-time-paced CPU (~10 MHz), never flat-out. Patches:
  tools/dmdbridge/patches/.
- The infamous "55K download stall" was **not a stall**: 32ld sends only muxterm's
  text+data (**50,324 B** per its COFF header; entry 0x71e85c), not the 144,603-B file —
  the rest is symbol table. ~55K on the wire = complete download + idle mux desktop.
  Measure protocol progress against *loadable* size, never `ls -l`.
- The 5620 mouse registers (0x400000 y, 0x400002 x) are free-running counters; muxterm
  integrates sample deltas with **y counting up the screen** from a (0,0) cursor. Feed
  deltas, not absolute positions (see the bridge's mouse model).
- V10's `/usr/include` is a 1997 reconstruction of a 1995 tree — expect header/source skew
  during Track B; log every reconciliation as a patch.
- The Alhadis GitHub mirrors are incomplete (v10 mirror omits `630/`) — TUHS tarballs are
  the source of truth.
- SIMH channel semantics differ per path: ^E stops the sim **only** on a local-tty
  console; it's an inert data byte on a telnet console, and a suspend-to-command-mode on
  the remote console; scp's `sim>` lives on stdin, never on the console socket. Read the
  table in [docs/a1-notes.md](docs/a1-notes.md) before touching console/control plumbing.
- The SIMH remote-console dialect (the app's control channel): never reply to telnet IAC
  (the session goes permanently silent), lead every command with a sacrificial space
  (multi-command-mode typeahead loses its first byte), and prove completion with
  output-anchored `echo` markers (`"\nMARKER"`) — the `sim>` prompt prints lazily.
- In-app SIMH listeners must rotate ports per launch: tmxr binds without `SO_REUSEADDR`,
  so a quick relaunch hits the previous incarnation's TIME_WAIT pairs ("bind error 48")
  and scp runs with **no listeners**; a failed console re-attach also leaves the restore
  path one `cont` from a NULL-deref segfault (`_tmxr_activate_delay`). Don't "fix" the
  crash with `reset tti` — that zeroes the guest-configured CSR and V8 stops seeing
  console input.
- A `state.sav` is only disk-consistent while the machine stays paused — the app deletes
  it the moment the machine runs again; unclean kills cold-boot and V8's autoboot fsck
  self-heals (with a telnet console V8 autoboots straight to `login:`, no single-user
  stop).
- NWConnection to loopback parks in `.waiting(ECONNREFUSED)` forever when it races the
  listener (no reachability change is coming) — treat `.waiting` as a failed attempt and
  redial fresh.
- `libsimh` compiles without `SIM_ASYNCH_IO`, so `set noasynch` errors ("Command not
  allowed") and is unnecessary — the V8-safe synchronous mode is a build-time guarantee.

## Conventions

- Big binaries (disk images, tapes, tarballs) never enter git — rebuild locally per the
  runbook (gitignored: `*.disk`, `*.tap`, `work/`).
- [docs/spike-a0.md](docs/spike-a0.md) contains **VERIFY** markers on steps assembled from
  research but not yet executed — executing them, then correcting the doc and dropping the
  marker, is part of the spike's deliverable.
- Track B keeps pristine upstream sources separate from our patches; every fix is a logged
  patch with a rationale, plus a dated lab-notebook entry (`docs/v10-log/`).
- Cite primary sources (TUHS preferred) for factual claims in docs.
- Project automation: use `/verify-step` to resolve runbook VERIFY markers and `/v10-log`
  for Track B lab-notebook entries. Hooks (`.claude/settings.json` + `tools/*.sh`) enforce
  the no-binaries rule and check markdown links on edit.

## Status / next step

Phase **A1 is complete** — see [docs/a1-notes.md](docs/a1-notes.md): the deferred
open-simh + `set noasync` re-verification passed (issue #425 regression check), `libsimh/`
packages `vax780` as `SimhVAX.xcframework`, and the Edition app boots V8 to `login:` in a
SwiftTerm console in ~25–30 s with save/restore instant-on (3/3 terminate→relaunch
cycles; evidence in `work/shots-a1-final/`). A0's results remain in
[docs/spike-a0-results.md](docs/spike-a0-results.md) (mux end-to-end on the desktop
bridge). Next: **A2 — the Blit experience** (dmd_core for `aarch64-apple-ios`, Metal
framebuffer, serial transport v1→v2, input mapping) and Track B (V10 restoration) in
parallel; update the checkboxes in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) as phases complete.
